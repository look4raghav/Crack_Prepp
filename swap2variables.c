/*
The best way to swap two variables is to use a temporary variable.
*/

int a,b,t;
t = a;
a = b;
b = t;

/*
There is no way better than this as you will find out soon. There are a few slick expressions that do swap variables without using
temporary storage. But they come with their own set of problems.
