Can we do a Binary search on a linked list?


One solution to the inefficiency of getting the middle of the linked list during a binary search is to have the first node contain one additional
pointer that points to the node in the middle. Decide at the first node if you need to check the first or the second half of the linked list.
Continue doing that with each half-list.
